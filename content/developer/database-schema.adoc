== General principles and sample SQL queries

{{% notice warning %}}
Some of the queries provided below delete data from your database. Use at your own risk, and be sure
to create full backups before trying them. A single mistaken SQL query can produce irreparable 
damage to your database.

=== Unique identifiers

SuiteCRM uses UUID's for its unique identifiers. They look like this: `46c35607-bcad-c7f1-1745-558d6b858b27`. 
They can be generated in SQL and inserted into other queries as a sub-select:

[source,sql]
----
UPDATE some_table SET id=(SELECT uuid());
----

Historically, since the SugarCRM days, these id's have followed this format, but in practice _any_ format
was allowed, numeric, string, etc., as long as it was unique. This sometimes greatly facilitates imports
by allowing previous numbering schemes to be maintained.

=== Custom Fields

Custom fields get saved in tables with the same name as the module they are defined in, but with an 
appended suffix `_cstm`. 

Each custom field will have the name you entered for it in Studio, with a suffix `_c`.

Here is a sample query to join a module's table with some custom fields (in this case, a field called 
**age** when created in Studio):

[source,sql]
----
SELECT first_name, last_name, contacts_cstm.age_c 
  FROM `contacts`
  LEFT JOIN contacts_cstm 
       ON contacts.id = contacts_cstm.id_c
----

List orphaned records from `contacts_cstm`, where the base record is not present, but a row for it still
exists in the custom table:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * -- DELETE ChildTable
  FROM contacts_cstm ChildTable    
  LEFT JOIN contacts ParentTable 
       ON ChildTable.id_c = ParentTable.id
  WHERE ParentTable.id IS NULL
----

That query is a SELECT, but if you change the first line to what is after the comment (`--`),
it will delete those rows. Please read the warning above and decide responsibly.

=== Relationships

SuiteCRM does not rely on the database engine to enforce relationships (foreign key constraints, etc). 
All these things are handled at application level in our own PHP code.

In general, SuiteCRM also does not do any cascaded updates or cascaded deletes, there are only a few 
exceptions for some particular cases. This means that you might need some periodic database clean-up.
There is a "Prune database on the 1st of month" scheduled job that handles some of these tasks, 
but you need to evaluate your own case in order to decide on the appropriate house-cleaning tasks. 
There is no "one-size-fits-all" solution for this, so each implementation should take the necessary 
steps for its own case.

There is a table called `relationships` which contains metadata information retrieved from the **vardefs**.

==== Typical ways to JOIN tables

A few sample queries should suffice to give you an idea of how SuiteCRM tables typically reference each other:

. The query to get data from a **custom field** that was given above;
+
. Traversing a **Flex Relate** field where several connected record types are allowed. The `parent_type` 
field contains the name of the related module, while the `parent_id` is a foreign key into that module's table:
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT accounts.name, calls.name, calls.status
  FROM accounts
  INNER JOIN calls ON
        calls.parent_type = 'Accounts' AND
        calls.parent_id = accounts.id AND 
        calls.deleted = 0
  WHERE accounts.deleted = 0
----
+
. A query to traverse a **many-to-many relationship** using a middle table. In this example, a list of 
account names and linked contacts:
+
image:schema.png[Schema]
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT accounts.name, contacts.first_name, contacts.last_name
  FROM accounts
  INNER JOIN accounts_contacts
        ON (accounts.id = accounts_contacts.account_id AND accounts_contacts.deleted = 0) 
  INNER JOIN contacts
        ON (contacts.id = accounts_contacts.contact_id AND contacts.deleted = 0)
  WHERE accounts.deleted = 0
  ORDER BY accounts.name
----
+
. Traversing the **`email_addresses` relationship** to get the email addresses of Users (easily adaptable for
other modules, like Contacts, Leads, etc).
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT users.user_name,
      email_address
 FROM users
      LEFT JOIN email_addr_bean_rel
             ON email_addr_bean_rel.bean_id=users.id
               AND email_addr_bean_rel.bean_module = 'Users'
               AND email_addr_bean_rel.primary_address = 1
               AND email_addr_bean_rel.deleted = 0
      LEFT JOIN email_addresses
             ON email_addresses.id = email_addr_bean_rel.email_address_id
               AND email_addresses.deleted = 0
----

==== Cleaning up Relationships to deleted records

When you delete a record from a module, in many cases SuiteCRM does not delete all the associated records, 
because it is impossible to decide which should or should not be removed without knowing the specifics of each 
business. Not deleting is _generically_ the sensible, conservative approach. But if you decide in your
case you need to remove some left-overs from previously existing records, then the following should help you.

Here is a sample query to look for orphaned records, in this case security groups entries referring 
to missing records:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT record_id, module, s.deleted, c.last_name, c.deleted
  FROM securitygroups_records s    
       LEFT JOIN contacts c 
         ON s.record_id = c.id
  WHERE c.id IS NULL AND
        s.module='Contacts'  
----

This query can easily be turned into a DELETE in order to remove these records.

You might also make a simpler delete of rows where `deleted='1'`, where the relationship itself was deleted, 
even if the `record_id` still exists:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT record_id, module, deleted
  FROM securitygroups_records    
  WHERE module='Contacts' AND deleted='1'
----
